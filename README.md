# Predict_Housing_Price_using_ML_algorithms

- This is the very first hands-on project that I attempted to apply multiple Machine Learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, DecisionTreeRegression, RandomForestRegression and AdaBoost.

- Dataset used in this small project is California Housing Price dataset, which could be found in Kasac
